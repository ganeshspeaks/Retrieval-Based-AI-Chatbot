188,Chemistry Concept,"What is a Reversible Reaction?","A Reversible Reaction is a chemical reaction that can proceed in both forward and backward directions under certain conditions.","Equilibrium Chemistry"
189,Chemistry Concept,"What is Electrolysis?","Electrolysis is the process of using electricity to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction, such as water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen.","Electrochemistry"
190,Chemistry Concept,"What is the Haber Process?","The Haber Process is an industrial method for synthesizing ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen and hydrogen gases under high pressure and temperature.","Industrial Chemistry"
